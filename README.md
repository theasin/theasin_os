# TheasIN_OS
An operating system written in C++, made for fun.

This, in any case, is NOT an OS for everyday use, just a project of mine, made with an intention of having fun and learning about PC's hardware and software.

To build it you should have:
* `i686-elf-gcc` and `i686-elf-binutils` (both can be installed from AUR)
* `grub` and `xorriso` (making ISO images, cruical for testing)
* `p7zip` (compression for final build)
